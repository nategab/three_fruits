This project is a puzzle for a treasure hunt that involves the Circuit Playground Express and fruit. It was designed to get kids to think about the relationship among various colors. The puzzle took advantage of three capacitive touch switches on the CPX. Each of the three were connected to: an apple, a banana, and a box of blueberries. Touching each of the fruits causes the LEDs on the CPX to light up - red for the apple, yellow for the banana, blue for the blueberries. Touching two of the three lit the LEDs in the appropriate color (apple and banana makes orange, etc). Finally, touching all three lit the LEDs in white and played "ta-da!".
